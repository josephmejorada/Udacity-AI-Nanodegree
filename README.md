# Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program - Projects

This repository showcases the projects I have completed as part of Udacity's AI Nanodegree Program. The program is divided into three parts.

## Part 1: Foundations of AI

This term covers the fundamentals of AI. Topics include Game-Playing, Search, Optimization, Probabilistic AIs, and Hidden Markov Models.

- Project 1: [Solve a Sudoku with AI](AIND1-Sudoku.md)
- Project 2: [Build a Game-Playing Agent](AIND1-Isolation.md)
- Project 3: [Implement a Planning Search](AIND1-Planning.md)
- Project 4: [Build an American Sign Language Recognizer](AIND1-Recognizer.md)

## Part 2: Deep Learning and Applications

This term covers the cutting edge advancements of AI and Deep Learning. Applications of Deep Learning techniques include Computer Vision, Speech, and Natural Language Processing. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and other advanced models are utilized in these projects.

- Project 1: [Dog Breed Classifier](AIND2-dog-project.md)
- Project 2: [Time Series Prediction of Stock Prices and Text Generation](AIND2-rnn.md)

## Part 3: Natural Langauge Processing (NLP)

This module dives deep into building end-to-end NLP pipelines to be used for different tasks such as Sentiment Analysis, Spam Detection, and Machine Translation using RNNs.

- Capstone Project: [Machine Translation from English to French](AIND2-nlp-capstone.md)
